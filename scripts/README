Steps to Process 
================

1) Clip a subset of hydro net junctions that matches the stream network to be analyzed.  Do this by creating a .001 thickness buffer layer on the stream network shapes, and processing the hydro net junctions layer for intersections with the buffer.

2) Import stream and junctions shapes into postGIS
shp2pgsql PassumpsicHydroNetJunctions.shp | psql streams
shp2pgsql PassumpsicHIGH.shp | psql streams

3) Run stream_preprocessing.py  note: it's necessary to change the table names in this file
python stream_preprocessing.py

note: if you run this script repeatedly, you need to skip the lines that create new table columns

4) Run stream_order.py note: it's necessary to change the table names in this file 
python stream_order.py

5) Run assign_elevations.sql
psql streams < assign_elevations.sql

6) Run merge_lines.sql
psql streams < merge_lines.sql
